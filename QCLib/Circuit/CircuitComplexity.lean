# Experimental file

Incomplete and note used anywhere. Currently stated only for `n` qubit circuits with `n > 1`.

--

The aim of this file is establish a framework for talking about circuit complexity measures.

The circuit complexity of a unitary can be measured in various ways: The minimal
number of two-qubit gates required to produce it / the minimal depth of a
circuit / number of non-Clifford gates / in terms of a precise or approximate
realization...

All natural complexity measures are subadditive, in that `f (a * b) ≤ f a + f b`.
This behavior is captured by the Mathlib typeclass `MulLEAddHomClass`. There is
also `GroupSeminormClass`, which adds the assumptions `f 1 = 0` (sensible for
complexity measures) and `f a⁻¹ = f a` (which is not necessarily true for gate
sets that aren't closed under taking inverses).

There is not too much API provided for these classes. Still, we build on them.

For now, we work with `GroupSeminormClass`, though relaxing that is TBD.



Define the complexity of a unitary in terms of the number of two-qubit gates required to express it.

This should be generalized to `k`-local gates. (In particular, the definitions
don't work for `n=1`. While the case is not interesting from a
complexity-theoretic perspective, it's a bit inelegant not covering it).

## Main Definitions

* `GateComplexityFun₂ : 𝐔[Register n] → ℕ∞`: Minimal number of two-qubit gates
required to express a unitary.

## Main Results

* A bundled version of `GateComplexityFun₂` is an instance of `GroupSeminormClass`

## TODO

* Define more complexity measures.

* Every unitary has  finite complexity in terms of two-qubit gates. See, e.g.  https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9503016. It would be very nice to a have a formalized proof of this result.

* Actually apply the lemmas in the `GroupSeminorm` section to concrete unitaries.
